* [WIP]

* Disclaimer: This is still very much before even beta or even a working state (it barely functions)
It currently barely works (only reason this is public is because others may want to see for reference.
I wouldn't suggest using this at all and it may undergo heavy changes as the code currently isn't very clean or good.

* For people that have brain damage (anyone who wants to use it)
** Keybinds
mod1 is alt
- mod1 + enter : alacritty
- mod1 + d     : rofi
- mod1 + t     : change next tile direction
- mod1 + e     : exit
There is currently no good system for keybinds, but it is coming later.
