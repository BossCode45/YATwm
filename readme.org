* [WIP]

* Disclaimer: This is still very much before even beta or even a working state (it barely functions)
It currently barely works (only reason this is public is because others may want to see for reference.
I wouldn't suggest using this at all and it may undergo heavy changes as the code currently isn't very clean or good.

* For people that have brain damage (anyone who wants to use it)
** Keybinds
mod1 is alt
- mod1 + enter	: alacritty
- mod1 + d		: rofi
- mod1 + t		: change next tile direction
- mod1 + e		: exit
- mod1 + q		: quit focused window
Add new keybinds reffering to the pre existing ones - docs coming later
