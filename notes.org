#+TITLE: Features to add

* Remembering focus
Use the variable ~whichChildFocused~ for each non client frame, this is the index of the child that is focused. To then find focused child for a root recurse through all the frames going through the focused child.
** Where it should be updated
+ When focus is moved
+ When a client is moved (because it should retain focus)
+ When a client is deleted (if it had focus before)
** Where it should be used
Whenever I set focus I should use the focused client of whichever workspace is focused

* Change focus and move between monitors
Perhaps I can just add something to the ~dirFind~ function

* TOML config
put in ~/.config/YATwm/config.toml

* Fullscreen windows
This should be another thing like floating windows except each workspace only gets one
I should check it first when tiling and if it exists then draw it to the size of the screeen then return

* General EWMH things
I should really figure out what all the client messages mean

* The eventual program to communicate with YATwm
Use a unix socket
