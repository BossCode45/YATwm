#+TITLE: Features to add

* Main refactor for the future
** Make it possible to split up the code into mulitple files easier
- Header files for some functions such as ~tileRoots~, potentially classes as well
- Main variables like the list of clients as a stuct, pointer can then be passed for things like EWMH

* Remembering focus
Use the variable ~whichChildFocused~ for each non client frame, this is the index of the child that is focused. To then find focused child for a root recurse through all the frames going through the focused child.
** Where it should be updated
+ When focus is moved
+ When a client is moved (because it should retain focus)
+ When a client is deleted (if it had focus before)
** Where it should be used
Whenever I set focus I should use the focused client of whichever workspace is focused

* Config
rewrite it to be a scripting language like i3

* Fullscreen windows
This should be another thing like floating windows except each workspace only gets one
I should check it first when tiling and if it exists then draw it to the size of the screeen then return

* General EWMH things
** I should really figure out what all the client messages mean
- ~_NET_WM_STATE~ is used to change a windows state e.g. moving to fullscreen. It is an ~Atom[]~

* The eventual program to communicate with YATwm
Use a unix socket
Same protocol as config langauge
