#+TITLE: Notes for myself to read

* Multiple monitors
** How I tell which monitor
- First I should check the currently focsued window
- Seccondly I should get the current mouseX and mouseY
  - If the mouseX and mouseY match the old ones then use the focusedScreen
  - If not then use mouseX and mouseY
** When to update mouseX and mouseY
Whenever I change focus or focused screen or map a new window
Or just updating every key press should work
** When to change focusedScreen
It should get changed when I change workspace to one that should go on a different screen
** How to tell which monitor to focus when changing workspace
There should be an array with the priorities.

* Fullscreen windows
This should be another thing like floating windows except each workspace only gets one
I should check it first when tiling and if it exists then draw it to the size of the screeen then return

* General EWMH things
I should really figure out what all the client messages mean

* The eventual program to communicate with YAT
Use a unix socket
